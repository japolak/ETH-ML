Our task is to predict classes (0,1,2) for a given x1-x20 features. First, we analysed the distribution of the data and plotted scatterplots of features if there are any visible patterns, but nothing apparent. Second, we computed the correlations between features and based on that performed variable selection as features x18,x19 and x20 were dropped due to correlation 1. By other feature selection method (eg. feature importance from RF) we also dropped x1, x2, x4, x5, x6, x8, x16, x17. Other feature selection techniques were tried but any different feature subsets haven't significantly outperformed the previously selected subset (stayed within 1 standard deviation of accuracy score computed from 10 fold Cross Validation).
The best performing model out of SVC, KNN, RF, XGB and NN was the Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron) which outperformed others both on cross validation score and on validation set (hold out set). The architecture of the NN was following. Two hidden layers of 100 nodes each with ReLU activation function and the output layer with 3 nodes representing the 3 classes with softmax activation function. We also used dropout of .5 and batch normalisation. At the end it was trained on 500 epochs with batches of size 200 samples.
