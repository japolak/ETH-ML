Several approaches were tried to in this Heart-Rythm Classification problem given the time-series data of Electrocardio graphy.
The approach of manual feature extraction resulted to be the most fruithful one.
Most features were extracted using the BioSPPY toolbox in python.
It was used for R peaks detection, QRS complex duration and also to separate individual heartbeats.
For each patient/observation we calculated the average/median heartbeat and also included the heartbeats falling into .1, .25, .75 and .9 quantiles.
However the Signal Processing - Wavelet Tranformations toolbox in matlab and autoregressive coefficients were also used as features.
The final model were a Neural Network build based on approach in the book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron.
It had 3 hidden layers each with 500 neurons and activation function relu, sigmoid, sigmoid in this respective order. We also used a dropout rate of .75
This model performed 9/10 times in 10 fold cross validation above the hard baseline.
